 Myeloma is a type of blood cancer that affects the 
plasma cells in the bone marrow, which produces antibodies 
that help the immune system to fight against outside 
aggression. Myeloma results in production of abnormal antibodies thereby weaking the function of the immune system. 
Out of the different types of blood cancers, the proposed 
research provides a robust mechanism for Multiple 
Myeloma (MM) prediction using 85 Microscopic blood 
images that were captured from bone marrow aspiration of 
patients suffering from the disease. The proposed work 
eradicates the probability of errors in the manual process of 
feature extraction by employing Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) for it and this is followed by training the 
model with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support 
Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest algorithms for 
classification. Along with SVM and Random Forest we used 
Random Search Optimizer for finding the suitable set of 
hyper parameters for better results. The overall accuracy 
was recorded to be 95%, for CNN-ANN model. Thus, the 
model can be used effectively for determining the Multiple 
Myeloma from the cell images.
